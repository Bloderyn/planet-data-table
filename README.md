# Planter Data Table - HTML Learning exercice 

This project is part of my journey learning **web development fundamentals** and gradually building my portfolio. 

It is a solution to the Planet Data Table exercice from MDN Web Docs, focused on understanding how to structure tabular data correctly using semantic HTML. 


# What I'm learning with this Project? 

Through this exercice, I practised: 
- Writing semantic HTML tables
- Using the correct elements: `<table>`, `<caption>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<th>`, `<th>`
- Understanding how `scope`, `rowspan`, and `colspan` work.
- Organizing complex data in a clear and logical way
- Learning why accessibility matters, especially for tables
This project helped me understand that tables are meant for data, not for layout.

 # Technologies used
 - HTML5
 - MDN Web Docs (learning reference)
 - CSS (given by MDN exercice)
